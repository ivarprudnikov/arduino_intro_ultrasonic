Ultrasonic sensor with Arduino UNO
======================================

**What it does**

Sensor measures distance and if it is less than 4cm then left LED lights up, otherwise right one.

**Parts**

- Arduino UNO
- USB cable
- LED x 2
- Resistor 68 Ohm x 2
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Male to Male Breadboard Jumper Cable Wires x 7
- Breadboard

**Code**

Source code in `main` needs to be uploaded to the board.

**Note**

Please note that schema image contains IR sensor instead of Ultrasonic one.
Originally I used Seed Studio ultrasonic sensor (V1.0) that has 3 legs (SIG, VCC, GND)
